# How to Launch a Voucher Collection

This guide will walk you through the process of launching a voucher collection on the Aztec network with Raven House.

Raven House provides the essential infrastructure for vouchers on the Aztec layer 2 blockchain. It leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs and client-side proving to bring true privacy to your digital vouchers.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you'll need an Aztec-compatible wallet. If you haven't set one up yet, please follow this guide to set up your wallet.

ðŸ‘‰ Setup your Wallet: [https://docs.ravenhouse.xyz/wallets/obsidion](https://docs.ravenhouse.xyz/wallets/obsidion)

Ready? Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create Your Voucher Collection

The first step is to define the core details and economics of your voucher collection.

### 1.1 Voucher Collection Details

Navigate to the [Create Collection](https://app.ravenhouse.xyz/collection/create) page and select the "Voucher Collection" tab. Here, you'll fill out the foundational information for your voucher project. 

* **Collection Name**: The public name of your voucher collection (e.g., "Testnet Edition").
* **Voucher Amount**: The monetary value that users will receive when they claim this voucher (e.g., 10 USDC). This is the core value proposition of your voucher collection.
* **Description**: A detailed description of your voucher collection's purpose and what users can redeem it for.

### 1.2 Choose Voucher Background

Instead of uploading collection and banner images like standard NFT collections, voucher collections use a voucher background template. This background will be used as the visual base for all vouchers in your collection.

You have two options:

#### Option 1: Choose from Templates
Select from pre-designed voucher backgrounds that follow the Raven House aesthetic:

![Choose Voucher Background Templates](/img/docs/voucher-collection/voucher-background-templates.png)

#### Option 2: Upload Custom Background
Upload your own custom voucher background with the recommended dimensions:

* **Recommended Dimensions**: 334 Ã— 207 pixels
* **Alternative Dimensions**: You can use multiples of the base template (e.g., 668 Ã— 414, 1002 Ã— 621, etc.)
* **File Format**: PNG recommended for best quality

![Upload Custom Voucher Background](/img/docs/voucher-collection/upload-custom-voucher-background.png)

> **Design Tip**: For best results, use images with 334 Ã— 207 pixel dimensions. The platform supports larger dimensions as long as they maintain the same aspect ratio (n Ã— 334 by n Ã— 207).

### 1.3 Economics & Supply

Set up the basic economic rules for your voucher collection:

* **Mint Price**: The cost to mint one voucher (e.g., 0 USDC for free mints).
* **Royalty Fee**: The percentage you'll earn from secondary sales of vouchers.
* **Max Supply**: The total number of vouchers that can ever be created. You can also check the box for an unlimited supply.
* **Mint Limit per Wallet**: The maximum number of vouchers a single wallet can mint. You can also disable this limit.

![Voucher Economics & Supply](/img/docs/voucher-collection/voucher-economics-form.png)

### 1.4 Public Minting & Mint Stages

Configure how your voucher collection will be available for minting. This feature gives you complete control over who can mint vouchers and when.

#### Public Minting Toggle

By default, the **Public Minting** toggle is enabled. This setting controls whether you want to include public mint stages in your voucher collection:

* **When enabled**: You can create both whitelist stages and public mint stages (they can run simultaneously or separately)
* **When disabled**: You can only create whitelist stages for your voucher collection

![Public Minting Toggle](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/public-minting-toggle.png)

#### Mint Stages Configuration

Based on your Public Minting setting, you'll see different stage options:

**If Public Minting is Disabled:**
- You'll see only the **"Add Whitelist Stage"** button
- This creates a whitelist-only voucher collection where you can set up multiple whitelist stages with different timings and prices

![Whitelist Only Mode](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/whitelist-only-mode.png)

**If Public Minting is Enabled:**
- You'll see both **"Add Whitelist Stage"** and **"Add Public Mint Stage"** buttons
- This allows you to create flexible minting strategies with any combination of whitelist and public stages

![Public Minting Enabled](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/public-minting-enabled.png)

#### Adding a Whitelist Stage

Click **"Add Whitelist Stage"** to open the "Configure Whitelist Stage" modal:

* **Mint Price (Whitelist)**: Set a special price for whitelisted users (often lower than public price)
* **Mint Start Date & Time**: Choose the exact moment when whitelist minting begins
* **Stage Duration**: Set how long the whitelist stage lasts (in days and hours)

![Configure Whitelist Stage Modal](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/configure-whitelist-stage.png)

> **Note**: After launching your voucher collection, you'll need to add whitelist users and enable the whitelist. [Learn how to manage your whitelist â†’](/guides/whitelist-management)

#### Adding a Public Mint Stage

Click **"Add Public Mint Stage"** to open the "Configure Public Mint Stage" modal:

* **Mint Price**: Set the public minting price
* **Mint Start Date & Time**: Choose when public minting begins
* **Stage Duration**: Set how long public minting lasts (in days and hours)

![Configure Public Mint Stage Modal](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/configure-public-mint-stage.png)

#### How Mint Stages Work

Mint stages give you complete flexibility in how your voucher collection is released:

* **Independent Timing**: Each stage has its own start time and duration
* **Overlapping Stages**: Whitelist and public stages can run simultaneously, allowing both groups to mint at the same time
* **Different Pricing**: You can set different prices for whitelist and public stages, even when they overlap
* **Sequential Stages**: You can also run stages one after another without overlap


![Mint Stages Overview](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/mint-stages-overview.png)

Once you've configured all your settings and stages, click "Launch Collection".

## Step 2: Launch Your Voucher Collection

Unlike standard NFT collections that require uploading assets, voucher collections can be launched immediately after configuration. This step deploys your voucher collection's smart contract to the Aztec network, making it live and ready for minting and claiming.

You can choose to launch immediately or come back and do it later from your profile page.

![Launch Voucher Collection](/img/docs/voucher-collection/launch-voucher-collection.png)

When you're ready, click "Launch Collection". A final confirmation pop-up will appear, summarizing your voucher collection's details. Review everything carefully, as this action cannot be undone.

**Key Launch Details to Review:**
- Collection name and symbol
- Voucher amount (the claimable value)
- Total max supply

---

## Step 3: Fund Your Voucher Collection

This is the crucial final step! After launching your voucher collection, you need to fund it so users can actually claim the voucher value you promised.

### 3.1 Understanding Voucher Funding

When users mint vouchers from your collection, they receive vouchers worth the amount you specified (e.g., 10 USDC). However, for users to actually claim this value, your collection needs to be funded with the corresponding amount.

### 3.2 Fund Your Collection

Navigate to the funding page for your voucher collection:

![Fund Voucher Collection](/img/docs/voucher-collection/fund-voucher-collection.png)

Here you'll see:

* **Collection Details**: Overview of your voucher collection including name, contract address, voucher amount, and max supply
* **Total Funding Needed**: The maximum amount needed if all vouchers are minted and claimed (Voucher Amount Ã— Max Supply)
* **Funding Amount**: Choose how much to fund initially

### 3.3 Funding Strategies

You don't need to fund the entire collection at once. Consider these strategies:

* **Partial Funding**: Fund 25%, 50%, or 75% initially and add more funds as needed
* **Full Funding**: Fund the entire collection upfront for complete security
* **Progressive Funding**: Start with a smaller amount and increase funding as minting activity grows

![Funding Options](/img/docs/voucher-collection/voucher-funding-options.png)

> **Important**: Users can only claim vouchers while funds are available in the collection. If funds run out, claiming will be temporarily disabled until you add more funds.

Click **"Fund Collection"** to complete the process. Your voucher collection is now fully operational!

## Managing Your Voucher Collection After Launch

### Monitoring Fund Levels

Keep track of your collection's funding status:
- Check remaining funds regularly
- Monitor claiming activity
- Add funds proactively to ensure uninterrupted claiming

### Whitelist Management

If you created whitelist stages, you'll need to:
1. Add approved wallet addresses to your whitelist
2. Enable the whitelist functionality
3. Monitor and manage whitelist access

{/* TODO: Improve below section before uncommenting it */}
{/* ### Voucher Claiming Process

Users who mint vouchers can claim their value by:
1. Holding the voucher in their wallet
2. Navigating to the claim interface
3. Redeeming the voucher for the specified USDC amount
4. Receiving funds privately through Aztec's zero-knowledge infrastructure */}

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Contract deployment fails**: Check your wallet connection and try again
- **Funding transaction fails**: Ensure you have sufficient balance and try again
- **Whitelist not working**: Verify whitelist is enabled and users are properly added
- **Users can't claim**: Check if collection has sufficient funds
