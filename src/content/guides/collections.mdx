## Collection Creation Process

The collection creation is divided into three main steps that guide you through the entire process:

### Step 1: Create Collection

This step covers the basic collection setup including details, traits, and economics.

#### Collection Details

![Collection Details Form](/img/docs/collection-details.png)

**Basic Information:**
- **Collection Name**: Give your collection a descriptive name
- **Collection Symbol**: A short symbol to represent your collection (like a ticker symbol)
- **Description**: Describe your collection's theme, story, and purpose
- **Collection Image**: Upload a square image (recommended: 800×800px)
- **Banner Image**: Upload a wide banner (recommended: 1400×400px)

#### Define Traits

Traits are attributes that can be assigned to NFTs in your collection. They define the properties that make each NFT unique.

![Trait Definition Form](/img/docs/trait-definition.png)

For each trait, specify:

- **Trait Key**: The name of the trait (e.g., "Background", "Eyes", "Rarity")
- **Type**: The data type of the trait:
  - **Text**: String values (e.g., "Red", "Blue", "Rare")
  - **Number**: Numeric values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 10.5)
  - **Yes/No**: Boolean values (true/false)
- **Description**: (Optional) Explain what the trait represents

Click "Add Trait" to add multiple traits to your collection.

#### Economics & Supply

![Economics Form](/img/docs/economics-form.png)

Define the economic parameters of your collection:

- **Mint Price**: The cost for users to mint an NFT from this collection (in USDC)
- **Royalty Fee**: *(Coming Soon)* The percentage you earn from secondary sales
- **Max Supply**: The maximum number of NFTs that can exist in this collection (check "Set unlimited supply" for no limit)
- **Mint Limit per Wallet**: The maximum number an individual wallet can mint (check "No limit per wallet" for unlimited)
- **Mint Start Date & Time**: *(Coming Soon)* When minting will become available
- **Public Minting**: Toggle whether anyone can mint from this collection or only approved wallets

After completing all sections, click **Create Collection** to proceed to Step 2.

> **Note**: You can edit collection details by clicking "Go Back" from Step 2, but only if the collection hasn't been launched yet.

### Step 2: Upload NFTs (Optional)

After creating your collection, you can upload NFTs in bulk or skip this step to add them later.
![Upload NFTs Interface](/img/docs/upload-nfts.png)

#### Bulk Upload Process

1. **Prepare Your Files**: Create a ZIP file containing:
   - An **images** folder with PNG images named sequentially (1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.)
   - A **metadata.json** file with details for each NFT

2. **Upload and Validate**: 
   - Upload your ZIP file
   - Click "Validate ZIP" to check the format
   - Review any validation errors and fix them

3. **Process Upload**:
   - Once validated, click "Upload to Collection"
   - NFTs will be added to your collection database

#### Example metadata.json format:
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "nfts": [
    {
      "name": "Cool Cat #1",
      "description": "A rare cool cat with blue background",
      "traits": [
        { "trait_type": "background", "value": "blue" },
        { "trait_type": "rarity", "value": "rare" },
        { "trait_type": "has_hat", "value": true }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Cool Cat #2", 
      "description": "A common cool cat with red background",
      "traits": [
        { "trait_type": "background", "value": "red" },
        { "trait_type": "rarity", "value": "common" },
        { "trait_type": "has_hat", "value": false }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Alternative Options

- **Skip This Step**: Continue to launch without uploading NFTs
- **Upload Later**: Add NFTs from your collection page after launching
{/* - **Individual Minting**: Create NFTs one by one using the "Mint New NFT" feature */}

### Step 3: Launch Collection

The final step deploys your collection smart contract to the Aztec Network.

![Launch Collection Interface](/img/docs/launch-collection.png)

#### What Happens During Launch

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**: Your collection becomes a smart contract on Aztec
2. **On-Chain Registration**: Collection details are stored on the blockchain
3. **Minting Activation**: Users can now mint NFTs from your collection

#### Launch Process

1. **Review Collection**: Verify all details are correct
2. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure your wallet is connected
3. **Deploy Contract**: Click "Launch Collection" and confirm the transaction
4. **Wait for Confirmation**: The deployment process may take a few minutes

#### After Launch

- Your collection will have a contract address
- Users can start minting NFTs
- You can assign minter roles to other wallets
- Collection details cannot be edited anymore

> **Important**: Once launched, collection details (name, symbol, traits, economics) cannot be modified.

## Post-Launch Management

### Viewing Your Collections

Visit your **Profile** page to see all collections you've created, showing:

- Collection status (launched or not launched)
{/* - Contract addresses for launched collections */}
{/* - Management options for each collection */}

### Managing Launched Collections

#### Assigning Minter Role

To allow others to mint NFTs in your collection:

1. Go to your Profile page
2. Find the collection and click "Assign Minter Role"
3. Enter the wallet address of the user you want to designate as a minter
4. Confirm the transaction

#### Uploading NFTs After Launch

You can still add NFTs to launched collections:

1. Navigate to your collection page
2. Click "Upload Collection Metadata"
3. Follow the same ZIP upload process described in Step 2

{/* #### Contract Verification

If you switch networks or PXE environments, you may need to redeploy:

1. The system will show "Contract not found in current PXE"
2. Click "Redeploy Contract" to deploy to the new environment
3. This creates a new instance while keeping your collection data */}

{/* ### Individual NFT Minting

For creating single NFTs:

1. Navigate to your collection page and click "Mint New NFT"
2. Or use the "Mint NFT" option in the navigation
3. Fill in NFT details and trait values
4. Upload the NFT image
5. Confirm the minting transaction */}

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Collection

- **Define traits early**: Plan your trait structure before creating the collection
- **Consider economics**: Set appropriate mint prices and supply limits
- **Prepare assets**: Have your images ready in the correct format before uploading

### Managing Supply

- **Set realistic limits**: Consider your community size when setting max supply
- **Plan mint limits**: Balance accessibility with preventing hoarding
- **Monitor minting**: Keep track of how many NFTs are minted

### Community Engagement

- **Announce launches**: Let your community know when you're launching
- **Set expectations**: Communicate mint prices and availability clearly
- **Use Discord integration**: Set up role verification for NFT holders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Validation errors**: Ensure your ZIP file structure matches the requirements exactly
- **Contract deployment fails**: Check your wallet connection and try again
{/* - **Images not displaying**: Verify image formats are PNG and properly named */}
