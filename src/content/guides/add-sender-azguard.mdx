# How to Add a Sender in Azguard Wallet

When performing private transactions on Aztec (such as transferring assets from public to private or private to private), the recipient must add the sender's wallet address to their Azguard wallet. Without this step, the recipient will not be able to see private NFTs or tokens in their wallet.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a required step for receiving any private assets. Make sure to add the sender.

## Why is This Necessary?

Private transactions on Aztec use encryption to hide transaction details. For a recipient to decrypt and view incoming private assets, they need to explicitly authorize the sender's address. This is a security feature that gives you control over who can send you private assets.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open Settings

Click on the **Settings** button located in the bottom right corner of your Azguard wallet.
