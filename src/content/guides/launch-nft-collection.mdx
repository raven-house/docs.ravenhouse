## Step 1: Set Up Your Collection

Begin by defining your collection’s identity, traits, economics, and minting strategy on the Raven House platform.

### 1.1 Define Your Collection

Navigate to the **Launch Collection** page on Raven House. Enter the core details to establish your collection’s identity.

**Example: Moonlit Guardians Collection**

- **Collection Name**: Moonlit Guardians
- **Collection Symbol**: MOON (used in the smart contract; cannot be changed)
- **Collection Image**: A 800x800px PNG of a glowing wolf emblem
- **Banner Image**: A 1400x400px PNG of a mystical forest under moonlight
- **Description**: “Moonlit Guardians is a collection of 1,000 unique NFTs celebrating mythical creatures protecting ancient forests. Each NFT grants access to exclusive community events and lore-driven quests.”

> [!TIP]
>
> Use high-quality images and a compelling description to attract collectors.

### 1.2 Configure NFT Traits

Define the traits that make each NFT unique. Traits are attributes like color, rarity, or type, which you’ll assign during asset upload.

**Example Traits for Moonlit Guardians**:

- **Trait Key**: Guardian Type
  - **Data Type**: Text
  - **Description**: Type of mythical creature (e.g., Wolf, Owl, Dragon)
- **Trait Key**: Rarity Tier
  - **Data Type**: Text
  - **Description**: Rarity level (e.g., Common, Rare, Legendary)
- **Trait Key**: Magic Affinity
  - **Data Type**: Yes/No
  - **Description**: Indicates if the guardian has magical powers

### 1.3 Set Economics and Supply

Configure the financial and supply rules for your collection.

**Example Settings for Moonlit Guardians**:

- **Mint Price**: 10 USDC per NFT
- **Royalty Fee**: 0 (will be supported in future versions)
- **Max Supply**: 1,000 NFTs (fixed supply for exclusivity)
- **Mint Limit per Wallet**: 5 NFTs to prevent oversaturation by single wallets

> [!TIP]
>
> Balance mint price and supply to align with your project’s goals and target audience.

### 1.4 Plan Minting Stages

Control who can mint your NFTs and when by setting up public and whitelisted minting stages.

#### Enable Public Minting

- **Toggle On**: Allows both public and whitelisted minting stages (flexible strategies).
- **Toggle Off**: Restricts minting to whitelisted addresses only.

![Public Minting Toggle](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/public-minting-toggle.png)

#### Add Whitelist Stages

Click **Add Whitelist Stage** to configure:

- **Mint Price**: 1 USDC (discount for whitelisted users)
- **Start Date & Time**: Aug 25, 2025, 12:00 PM UTC
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Example**: Early supporters of Moonlit Guardians get a discounted mint price.

![Whitelist Stage](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/configure-whitelist-stage.png)

#### Add Public Mint Stages

Click **Add Public Mint Stage** to configure:

- **Mint Price**: 10 USDC
- **Start Date & Time**: Aug 28, 2025, 12:00 PM UTC
- **Duration**: 7 days
- **Example**: General collectors can mint Moonlit Guardians after the whitelist phase.

![Public Mint Stage](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/configure-public-mint-stage.png)

#### Minting Strategies

- **Early Access**: Whitelist stage (Aug 25–27) followed by public stage (Aug 28– Sept 3).
- **Price Advantage**: Whitelist at 1 USDC, public at 10 USDC, running concurrently.
- **Sequential Phases**: Whitelist only (Days 1–3), then public only (Days 4–10).

## Step 2: Upload Assets

Upload your NFT images and metadata to bring your collection to life.

1. **Prepare Your Assets**:

   - Create a ZIP file containing:
     - PNG images for each NFT (e.g., `1.png`, `2.png` for Moonlit Guardians’ wolf and owl designs).
     - A `metadata.json` file mapping each NFT to its traits (e.g., `{ "1": { "Guardian Type": "Wolf", "Rarity Tier": "Rare", "Magic Affinity": true } }`).
   - Download our [Sample ZIP Template](https://oqymtqolwjujkayjyxdt.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/samples/Archive.zip) for the correct structure.

2. **Upload the ZIP**:

   - On the **Launch Collection** page, click to upload your ZIP file.
   - Raven House validates the file to ensure traits match your Step 1 definitions.

3. **Confirm Upload**:
   - Once validated, you’ll see a success message. Your NFTs are now linked to your collection, ready for minting.

![Upload Assets](/img/docs/upload-nfts.png)

**Tip**: Test your ZIP file with a small batch (e.g., 10 NFTs) to catch errors before uploading the full collection.

## Step 3: Deploy and Manage

Deploy your collection to the Aztec testnet and manage it post-launch.

### 3.1 Deploy Your Collection

- On the **Launch Collection** page, review your settings (name, traits, economics, stages).
- Click **Deploy Collection** to deploy the smart contract to Aztec.
- A confirmation pop-up summarizes your settings. Double-check, as deployment is irreversible.

![Deploy Collection](/img/docs/launch-collection.png)

**Tip**: Ensure your Azguard or Obsidion wallet is connected and funded with testnet tokens.

### 3.2 Manage Post-Launch

- **Whitelist Management**: Add wallet addresses and enable the whitelist for your stages. See [Whitelist Management Guide](/guides/whitelist-management).
- **Monitor Minting**: Track mint progress and adjust stages if needed.
- **Engage Community**: Use Raven House’s Discord bot to assign roles to NFT holders and share trading updates.

## Tips for Success

### Planning Your Launch

- **Time Zones**: Schedule mint stages for your audience’s primary time zones (e.g., UTC for global reach).
- **Marketing**: Announce your Moonlit Guardians launch on Discord and X to build hype.
- **Buffer Time**: Allow a 1–2 day buffer for technical issues during minting.

### Troubleshooting

- **ZIP Validation Errors**: Verify your `metadata.json` matches the trait structure defined in Step 1.
- **Deployment Fails**: Check wallet connection and testnet token balance in Azguard/Obsidion.
- **Whitelist Issues**: Ensure whitelist is enabled and addresses are correctly added.
- **Need Help?** Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/CR8nKg5gYB) or contact support via the Raven House platform.
