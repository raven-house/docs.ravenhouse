### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you'll need an Aztec-compatible wallet. If you haven't set one up yet, please follow this guide to set up your wallet.

Ready? Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create Your Collection

The first step is to define the core details, traits, and economics of your collection.

### 1.1 Collection Details

Navigate to the "Create Collection" page. Here, you'll fill out the foundational information for your NFT project.

* Collection Name: The public name of your collection (e.g., "Aztec Alpha Builders").
* Collection Symbol: A short ticker for your collection (e.g., "ALPHABUILDERS"). This will be used in the contract and cannot be changed.
* Collection Image: This is the main profile picture or logo for your collection. A resolution of 800x800px is recommended.
* Banner Image: A header image for your collection page. A resolution of 1400x400px is recommended.
* Description: A detailed description of your collection's purpose and vision.

### 1.2 Define Traits

Next, you'll define the traits that your NFTs can have. These traits are the properties that make each NFT unique and will be used when you mint them. You can define the trait's name (Trait Key), its data type (Text, Yes/No, Number), and a brief description.

![Define Traits](/img/docs/trait-definition.png)

### 1.3 Economics & Supply

Set up the basic economic rules for your collection:

* Mint Price: The base cost to mint one NFT (e.g., 1000 USDC).
* Royalty Fee: The percentage you'll earn from secondary sales.
* Max Supply: The total number of NFTs that can ever be created. You can also check the box for an unlimited supply.
* Mint Limit per Wallet: The maximum number of NFTs a single wallet can mint. You can also disable this limit.

### 1.4 Public Minting & Mint Stages

Configure how your collection will be available for minting. This new feature gives you complete control over who can mint and when.

#### Public Minting Toggle

By default, the **Public Minting** toggle is enabled. This setting controls whether you want to include public mint stages in your collection:

* **When enabled**: You can create both whitelist stages and public mint stages (they can run simultaneously or separately)
* **When disabled**: You can only create whitelist stages for your collection

![Public Minting Toggle](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/public-minting-toggle.png)

#### Mint Stages Configuration

Based on your Public Minting setting, you'll see different stage options:

**If Public Minting is Disabled:**
- You'll see only the **"Add Whitelist Stage"** button
- This creates a whitelist-only collection where you can set up multiple whitelist stages with different timings and prices

![Whitelist Only Mode](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/whitelist-only-mode.png)

**If Public Minting is Enabled:**
- You'll see both **"Add Whitelist Stage"** and **"Add Public Mint Stage"** buttons
- This allows you to create flexible minting strategies with any combination of whitelist and public stages

![Public Minting Enabled](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/public-minting-enabled.png)

#### Adding a Whitelist Stage

Click **"Add Whitelist Stage"** to open the "Configure Whitelist Stage" modal:

* **Mint Price (Whitelist)**: Set a special price for whitelisted users (often lower than public price)
* **Mint Start Date & Time**: Choose the exact moment when whitelist minting begins
* **Stage Duration**: Set how long the whitelist stage lasts (in days and hours)

![Configure Whitelist Stage Modal](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/configure-whitelist-stage.png)

> **Note**: After launching your collection, you'll need to add whitelist users and enable the whitelist. [Learn how to manage your whitelist â†’](/guides/whitelist-management)

#### Adding a Public Mint Stage

Click **"Add Public Mint Stage"** to open the "Configure Public Mint Stage" modal:

* **Mint Price**: Set the public minting price
* **Mint Start Date & Time**: Choose when public minting begins
* **Stage Duration**: Set how long public minting lasts (in days and hours)

![Configure Public Mint Stage Modal](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/configure-public-mint-stage.png)

#### How Mint Stages Work

Mint stages give you complete flexibility in how your collection is released:

* **Independent Timing**: Each stage has its own start time and duration
* **Overlapping Stages**: Whitelist and public stages can run simultaneously, allowing both groups to mint at the same time
* **Different Pricing**: You can set different prices for whitelist and public stages, even when they overlap
* **Sequential Stages**: You can also run stages one after another without overlap

**Popular Strategies:**
1. **Overlapping with Price Advantage**: Whitelist users get a lower price during the same period as public minting
2. **Early Access**: Whitelist stage starts first, then public stage begins while whitelist is still active
3. **Sequential Phases**: Whitelist stage (Days 1-3), then public stage (Days 4-10)
4. **Simultaneous Launch**: Both whitelist and public stages start at the same time with different prices

You can create multiple stages to implement any of these strategies:

Once you've configured all your settings and stages, click "Launch Collection".

## Step 2: Upload Your NFTs

With your collection created, it's time to upload your NFT assets and metadata. This step links your artwork and traits to the collection.

You will need to prepare a ZIP file containing your PNG image files and a metadata.json file. The platform provides a clear structure for the JSON file and a template ZIP for you to download.

![Upload NFTs](/img/docs/upload-nfts.png)

Click to upload your prepared ZIP file. The platform will validate it to ensure it matches the traits you defined in Step 1.

Once the upload is successful, you'll see a confirmation message. Your NFTs are now available in your collection, ready for minting once the collection is launched.

---

## Step 3: Launch Your Collection

This is the final step! Launching deploys your collection's smart contract to the Aztec network, making it live and ready for minting and trading.

You can choose to launch immediately or come back and do it later from your profile page.

![Launch Collection](/img/docs/launch-collection.png)

When you're ready, click "Launch Collection". A final confirmation pop-up will appear, summarizing your collection's details. Review everything carefully, as this action cannot be undone.

## Managing Your Collection After Launch

### Whitelist Management

If you created whitelist stages, you'll need to:
1. Add approved wallet addresses to your whitelist
2. Enable the whitelist functionality
3. Monitor and manage whitelist access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Validation errors**: Ensure your ZIP file structure matches the requirements exactly
