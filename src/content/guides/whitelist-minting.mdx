# Advanced Minting: Whitelist & Public Stages

Raven House now supports advanced minting configurations with **Whitelist Stages** and **Public Stages**, giving collection creators complete control over their NFT launches.

## Overview

The new minting system allows you to:
- **Create exclusive whitelist phases** with custom pricing and duration
- **Set up public minting phases** that start after whitelist ends
- **Control who can mint** at each stage
- **Offer different pricing** for different user groups
- **Create whitelist-only collections** by disabling public minting entirely

## Minting Stage Types

### Whitelist Stage
- **Who can mint**: Only pre-approved wallet addresses
- **Custom pricing**: Set different prices for whitelisted users
- **Time-limited**: Configure exact duration in days and hours
- **Priority access**: Always runs before public stages

### Public Stage
- **Who can mint**: Anyone with a wallet
- **Public pricing**: Standard pricing for general public
- **Sequential timing**: Starts automatically after whitelist stage ends
- **Optional**: Can be disabled for whitelist-only drops

## Setting Up Mint Stages

### Step 1: Configure Basic Timing

Before adding specific stages, set your collection's overall minting parameters:

1. **Mint Start Date & Time**: When the first minting stage begins
2. **Public Minting Toggle**: Choose whether to allow public minting at all

### Step 2: Choose Your Minting Strategy

You have three main approaches:

#### Option A: Whitelist + Public Minting 
Perfect for building hype with early access while still allowing public participation.

#### Option B: Whitelist-Only Minting
Ideal for exclusive drops or limited community releases.

#### Option C: Public-Only Minting (No Whitelist)
Best for simple launches where you want immediate public access without any exclusivity.

## Option A: Whitelist + Public Minting Setup

When **Public Minting is enabled**, you'll see two configuration buttons:

### Adding a Whitelist Stage

1. Click **"Add Whitelist Stage"**
2. The configuration modal will open with three fields:
   - **Mint Price (Whitelist)**: Special price for whitelisted users (e.g., 100 USDC)
   - **Stage Duration - Days**: How many full days the whitelist runs
   - **Stage Duration - Hours**: Additional hours for fine-tuned timing

![Whitelist stage modal](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/whitelist_stage_modal.png)


3. Click **"Save Stage"** to confirm

**Example Configuration:**
- Whitelist Price: 100 USDC
- Duration: 2 days, 12 hours
- Result: Whitelisted users can mint for 60 hours at the discounted price

### Adding a Public Stage

1. Click **"Add Public Mint Stage"**
2. Configure the public minting parameters:
   - **Mint Price (Public)**: Standard price for public users (e.g., 150 USDC)
   - **Stage Duration - Days**: How long public minting remains open
   - **Stage Duration - Hours**: Additional hours for timing precision

3. Click **"Save Stage"** to confirm

**Timeline Example:**
üïê MINT START: January 1st, 12:00 PM

WHITELIST PHASE (60 hours)
January 1st 12:00 PM ‚Üí January 3rd 12:00 PM
- Only whitelisted wallets can mint
- Price: 100 USDC
- Duration: 60 hours

PUBLIC PHASE (108 hours) 
January 3rd 12:00 PM ‚Üí January 8th 12:00 AM
- Anyone can mint (including whitelisted users)
- Price: 150 USDC  
- Duration: 108 hours

üèÅ MINTING ENDS: January 8th, 12:00 AM

## Option B: Whitelist-Only Setup

When **Public Minting is disabled**, you'll see only one button:

### Exclusive Whitelist Configuration

1. **Toggle off "Public Minting"**
2. Click **"Add Whitelist Stage"**
3. Configure your exclusive whitelist parameters:
   - **Mint Price (Whitelist)**: Price for whitelisted users only
   - **Stage Duration**: How long the whitelist window remains open

![Pulibc Minting Disabled](/img/docs/whitelist-mint/public_minting_disabled.png)

**Result:** Only pre-approved wallets can mint, creating an exclusive drop.

## Option C: Public-Only Minting (No Whitelist)

Want to skip the whitelist entirely and allow immediate public minting? Here's how:

### Quick Public Launch Setup

1. **Keep "Public Minting" enabled**
2. Click **"Add Whitelist Stage"** 
3. **Set whitelist duration to 0**:
   - Days: `0`
   - Hours: `0`
4. Click **"Add Public Mint Stage"**
5. Configure your public minting:
   - **Mint Price (Public)**: Your standard mint price
   - **Stage Duration**: How long you want public minting open

### What Happens:

```
üïê MINT START: January 1st, 12:00 PM

 WHITELIST PHASE (0 hours) 
- Skipped entirely (0 duration)


 PUBLIC PHASE (starts immediately)
January 1st 12:00 PM ‚Üí Your configured end time
- Anyone can mint immediately
- No whitelist restrictions
- Standard public pricing
```

**Perfect for:**
- Simple, straightforward launches
- Community drops without exclusivity
- Collections where you want immediate public access

### Pro Tip:
Even with 0 whitelist duration, you still need to add both stages. Think of the whitelist stage as a "setup requirement" that you're just setting to skip.


## Managing Your Whitelist

### Adding Addresses to Whitelist
*[This section would need to be added based on how the whitelist management actually works in your system]*

{/* ### Verifying Whitelist Status
Users can verify their whitelist status through:
- Collection page indicators
- Wallet connection status
- Discord role verification */}

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Whitelist Not Working**
- Verify wallet addresses are correctly added to whitelist
- Check that whitelist stage timing is configured correctly
- Ensure users are connecting the correct wallet

**Stage Timing Confusion**
- Remember: Stages run sequentially, not simultaneously
- Whitelist always runs first, then public (if enabled)
- Total minting time = Whitelist duration + Public duration
