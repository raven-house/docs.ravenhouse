# Managing Collection Whitelists

This guide covers how to add wallet addresses to your whitelist and manage whitelist access for your NFT collections after they've been launched.

## Overview

After launching a collection with whitelist stages, you need to add approved wallet addresses before minting begins. This process involves:

1. **Adding wallet addresses** to your collection's whitelist
2. **Validating addresses** to ensure they're correct
3. **Enabling the whitelist** to activate whitelist minting

## Prerequisites

Before managing your whitelist:
- ✅ Collection must be **created and launched**
- ✅ Collection must have **whitelist stages configured**
- ✅ You must be the **collection owner**
- ✅ Whitelist addresses should be **collected in advance**

## Step-by-Step Whitelist Setup

### Step 1: Access Whitelist Management

1. Navigate to your [Profile page](https://app.ravenhouse.xyz/profile)
2. Click on the **Collections** tab
3. Find your launched collection from the list
4. Click the **"Whitelist Users"** button on your collection card

### Step 3: Add Wallet Addresses

You have two methods to add addresses:

#### Method A: Manual Entry

**Best for**: Small lists (under 50 addresses)

1. **Paste addresses** directly into the text field
2. **Separate multiple addresses** using any of these methods:
   - **Commas**: `address1, address2, address3`
   - **Line breaks**: One address per line

**Example manual entry:**
```
0x305300e3fb7df256817494c02413f37622f8a775767bb1b7a214376e0af22aaa
0x2c19e17d4fb273ea5442588b42454c43afbf952f2da43c2ecfbb90298ad31110
0x2595f8b945e300d6808815e7d6a91d3ade7954fbab828cfeacfd91d39e264987
```

#### Method B: CSV Upload

**Best for**: Large lists (50+ addresses)

1. **Prepare your CSV file** with one address per row
2. **No headers needed** - just addresses
3. **Click "Choose CSV File"** and select your file
4. [Download our template](/examples/whitelist-template.csv) for the correct format

**CSV Format Example:**
```csv
0x2595f8b945e300d6808815e7d6a91d3ade7954fbab828cfeacfd91d39e264987
0x1de09fa8ebfed9835e4e47b3888a041b70cfbb979eab314b7e1c0a9248740ade
0x27fa20fedd4a2184038e09c05da04ea30af69a6d690eba3e19c499721b29e966
0x1de09fa8ebfed9835e4e47b3888a041b70cfbb979eab314b7e110a9248740ade
```
**Download CSV Template**: [Whitelist Template.csv](/examples/whitelist-template.csv)

### Step 4: Validate Addresses

After entering addresses (manual or CSV):

1. **Automatic validation** checks each address format
2. **Valid addresses** ✅ are accepted and counted
3. **Invalid addresses** ❌ show error messages
4. **Success confirmation** displays total addresses added

**Common validation errors:**
- Invalid address format

### Step 5: Enable Whitelist

1. **"Enable Whitelist" button activates** after successful address upload
2. **Click "Enable Whitelist"** to make the whitelist live
3. **Confirmation message** appears when whitelist is active
{/* 4. **Collection status** updates to show "Whitelist Active" */}

{/* //TODO: put screenshot */}
{/* *Screenshot needed: "Enable Whitelist" button in active state and confirmation message* */}


### Security Considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Enable Whitelist" Button Stays Disabled**
- ✅ Ensure at least one valid address is uploaded
- ✅ Check for validation error messages
- ✅ Try refreshing the page and re-uploading

**CSV Upload Fails**
- ✅ Verify CSV format matches template exactly
- ✅ Check for hidden characters or wrong encoding
- ✅ Try smaller batches if file is very large

**Addresses Not Being Accepted**
- ✅ Verify addresses are valid Aztec wallet format
- ✅ Check for extra spaces, commas, or characters
- ✅ Ensure addresses start with "0x"

**Users Can't Mint During Whitelist Phase**
- ✅ Confirm whitelist is enabled
- ✅ Verify user's exact address is in whitelist
