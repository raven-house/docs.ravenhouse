description: Step-by-step guide to importing USDC token on Azguard Wallet and using faucet to mint token on Aztec Testnet.
---

---

Azguard Wallet by default doesn't come with any ERC20 Token. You need to add the USDC Token to perform various operations across Raven House apps.

## Why do I need Tokens?

### Raven House NFT Marketplace
If you're using the [Raven House NFT Marketplace](https://app.ravenhouse.xyz), you'll need Tokens to:
- **Paid Mints** - Mint NFTs from collections with a mint price
- **Purchase NFTs** - Buy listed NFTs from other users
- **Make Offers** - Submit offers on NFTs you want to acquire

### Raven Bridge
If you're using the [Raven Bridge](https://bridge.ravenhouse.xyz), you'll need Tokens to:
- **Bridge tokens** - Transfer Tokens between Ethereum (L1) and Aztec (L2)
- **Test bridging flows** - Experiment with cross-layer transfers on testnet

## Add USDC to Azguard Wallet

### 1. Open Azguard Wallet

When you open the Azguard Wallet, you'll see the home screen.
