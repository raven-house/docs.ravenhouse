# Creating and Managing Collections

NFT collections on Raven House allow you to group related NFTs and define their common traits and economic parameters.

## Collection Creation Process

The collection creation process is now a multi-step wizard that guides you through each phase:

### Step 1: Collection Details

![Collection Details Form](/img/docs/collection-details.png)

- **Collection Name**: Give your collection a descriptive name
- **Collection Symbol**: A short symbol to represent your collection (like a ticker symbol)
- **Description**: Describe your collection's theme, story, and purpose
- **Collection Image**: Upload a square image (recommended: 800×800px)
- **Banner Image**: Upload a wide banner (recommended: 1400×400px)

### Step 2: Define Traits

Traits are attributes that can be assigned to NFTs in your collection. They define the properties that make each NFT unique.

![Trait Definition Form](/img/docs/trait-definition.png)

For each trait, specify:

- **Trait Key**: The name of the trait (e.g., "Background", "Eyes", "Rarity")
- **Type**: The data type of the trait:
  - **Text**: String values (e.g., "Red", "Blue", "Rare")
  - **Number**: Numeric values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 10.5)
  - **Yes/No**: Boolean values (true/false)
- **Description**: (Optional) Explain what the trait represents

Click "Add Trait" to add multiple traits to your collection.

### Step 3: Economics & Supply

![Economics Form](/img/docs/economics-form.png)

Define the economic parameters of your collection:

- **Mint Price**: The cost for users to mint an NFT from this collection (in RAVEN)
- **Royalty Fee**: The percentage you earn from secondary sales
- **Max Supply**: The maximum number of NFTs that can exist in this collection (check "Set unlimited supply" for no limit)
- **Mint Limit per Wallet**: The maximum number an individual wallet can mint (check "No limit per wallet" for unlimited)
- **Mint Start Date & Time**: (Optional) When minting will become available
- **Public Minting**: Toggle whether anyone can mint from this collection or only approved wallets

### Step 4: Upload NFTs (Optional)

After creating the collection, you can immediately upload NFTs:

- You can upload a ZIP file containing:
  - An "images" folder with PNG images named sequentially (1.png, 2.png, etc.)
  - A metadata.json file with details for each NFT
- This step can be skipped and done later from your collection page

### Step 5: Launch Collection (Optional)

- You can deploy your collection to the Aztec network immediately after creation
- This step requires having the RAVEN token deployed first
- You can also choose to launch your collection later from your profile page

## Launching Your Collection

After creating a collection, you'll need to launch it to make it available for minting:

1. Navigate to your Profile page
2. Find your collection in the "Your Collections" section
3. Click the "Launch" button

This deploys the smart contract for your collection on the Aztec Network.

## Managing Your Collection

### Viewing Your Collections

Visit your Profile page to see all collections you've created.

### Assigning Minter Role

To allow others to mint NFTs in your collection:

1. Go to your Profile page
2. Find the collection and click "Assign Minter Role"
3. Enter the wallet address of the user you want to designate as a minter
4. Confirm the transaction

### Uploading Multiple NFTs

For collections with many NFTs, you can use the bulk upload feature:

1. Navigate to your collection page
2. Click "Upload NFTs"
3. Prepare a ZIP file containing:
   - An "images" folder with PNG images named sequentially (1.png, 2.png, etc.)
   - A metadata.json file with details for each NFT (example format shown below)
4. Upload the ZIP file and validate
5. Process the upload to add NFTs to your collection

Example metadata.json format:
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "nfts": [
    {
      "name": "NFT #1",
      "description": "Description for NFT #1",
      "traits": [
        { "trait_type": "background", "value": "blue" },
        { "trait_type": "is rare", "value": true }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "NFT #2",
      "description": "Description for NFT #2",
      "traits": [
        { "trait_type": "background", "value": "red" },
        { "trait_type": "is rare", "value": false }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "NFT #3",
      "description": "Description for NFT #3",
      "traits": [
        { "trait_type": "background", "value": "green" },
        { "trait_type": "is rare", "value": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
